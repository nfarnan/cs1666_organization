  - Shader Languages
  - Broad Shader Types
  - Specific Shader Types
---------------------------------------------------
- Topic 2 Realtime Rendering and Phong(13 minutes):
  - Basics of the rendering pipeline
  - Meshes, textures, and U,V maps (touch lightly on shaders, Daniel will go in-depth on shaders)
  - Normal maps, and how this surface orientation information is encoded for use in the Phong formula
  - (Same thing with specular maps)
  - The Phong lighting formula
  - Short shader demo

- Topic 3 (13 minutes): Deferred Rendering and “Deferred-Lite” in 2D
  - What is Deferred Rendering?
  - Forward vs. Deferred Rendering: key differences
  - Why Deferred Rendering is useful for handling many lights
  - Simplified “Deferred-Lite” approach for 2D
  - Rendering normals to a texture (G-buffer Lite)
  - Fullscreen lighting pass using Lambert (diffuse-only) shading
